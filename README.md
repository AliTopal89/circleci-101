# circleci-101

The `- image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1` text tells CircleCI what Docker image to use when it builds your project. CircleCI will use the image to boot up a “container” — a virtual computing environment where it will install any languages, system utilities, dependencies, web browsers, and tools, that your project might need to run.
